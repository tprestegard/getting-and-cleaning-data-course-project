README file for Getting and Cleaning Data course project
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This repository contains code for cleaning a dataset as required for the course
project for "Getting and Cleaning Data".

The user should download the raw data and use the run_analysis.R script in this
repository to clean the data and produce the tidy dataset.  The script can be run as

```
run_analysis()
```

This code will write a single text file containing the tidy data called "tidy_data.txt,"
which is also included in this repository.  This file contains 66 different
variables from the raw dataset which have been averaged over subject and activity.

There is a code book in this repository called "CodeBook.md" which contains a description
of the raw and tidy data, the cleaning procedure, and descriptions of the variables.
